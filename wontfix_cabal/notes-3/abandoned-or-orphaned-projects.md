## Notes

Cubit - _Bamboo_ - Guy who wrote it left.

- Don't want to hurt feelings and write we don't support it.
- How do I handle this problem?

### When this happens
- Worked on places that have been heavily dependent, and support goes away.
- Maintaining projects that you don't use.
- Programming languages which you know longer understand.
- Legal issues with transferal
- Sometimes you don't want your brand to be related.
- Quality assurance is hard.
- Employees are let go; instantly orphaned.
- Long term maintenance becomes tenuous.
- Abandonware: Loss of hours; interest, time, gone.
  - They are open source - so you can use them if you could.
- Trademark issues.
- Lots of people who pop up when a project will die, who weren't active before
- Project management angle- forks active, forks which are further ahead
- Reusable components; can be made MIT license; and then acquired, so who is in charge?

### Solutions
- Need to set expectations clearly
- Someone who cares strongly about it can suggest another project
- Personal projects can be made into an organization easily.
- Healthy to let it go if possible.
- You can rebrand things, although there may be licensing issues.
- Be honest about something being mothballed or deprecated. Use ☠️
- Give other maintainers rights if you're not using it.
- Have 2 people internally who are willing to maintain it, or mothball it.
- Move thing to GitHub archive organization.

----

- Some projects are just dead. You're not working on it, or it was experimental, or so on.
- Orphaned projects are similar; you're not maintaining, but you're happy to have others do it.
- Different type of projects
  - Code dump. Maybe no README and so on.
  - Company decides what happens, and does direction. (Go, Google)
  - Company decides direction, but it's still community-run in theory (Kubernetes)
    - In this stage, a lot of these problems go away.
- Why do companies projects not tend to reach that final stage?
- Code dumps are the easiest way to open source. Unless it's niche, it won't become popular.
- Companies don't have the intelligence around what to do to make an open source project sustainable.
  - Not necessary for every project to reach the final stage of a project.
- There's also dichotomies between people using a thing and companies dumping things outside the fence
  - Companies need to have maintainers to make marketing a valuable resource
- The bar is higher for open source projects than for internal ones
  - The expectation for a README is totally different
  - Standard-readme; easy way to up the documentation for a thing
- "Only open source things which are used in production for six months"
  - No marketing projects
  - Actually works well, and that you depend on it
  - If it isn't used, it's probably solveable in some other way
  - State: No longer using this, but here is a replacement, here's why it doesn't work
  - Internal process for OS projects.
  - How do projects fit into a project portfolio
    - Are there projects which are going to compete with it, and so on
  - Not the bazaar method for writing software, though.
- Sometimes unmaintained crap is good. Rather it was code dump than not open source.
- If code isn't maintained, there may be security issues.
- Copyleft is on other people. License is a contract is between you and the thing.
- Some science research code dumps cannot be maintained. Should be archived.
- Expectation that corporate open source is being used. May come with the industry.
- If there are not 2 people internally, then open source it under your name, not the companies.
  - Watch out for contracts
- uBlock - multiple copies of the same code, forks, and then coming back. History help.
- Releases; if people need them, they can ask.
- If there are no releases, tags, etc. - then you should not use that.
- What is necessary for maintenance? Social signals.
- According to some philosophies, with open source, you have the right to walk away.
- Coding guilt is a powerful force
- Nonconsensual maintenance
- If you're not a dogfeeder, you should probably not be on the project
- Issues and PRs are generally negative, but it's hard to find things people like
- Homebrew: Adding autoupdate solved 90% of the problems, but made it a bit harder for everyone
- Handwritten letters of praise are the best!
- Homebrew: knowing analytics is fucking awesome
